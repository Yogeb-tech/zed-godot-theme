# Godot Engine Theme

## Introduction

This theme takes direct inspiration from the Godot Engine's editor, borrowing its clean, dark aesthetic and distinctive accent colors. I've always been a huge fan of how readable and visually balanced the Godot interface feels, and I wanted to capture that same vibe in zed.
